\section{Conclusions}
We have shown how the integral equation from the Neural CDE model can be solved with high accuracy over intervals larger than the discretisation of the data can be solved using the log-ODE method. We demonstrated that this not only enables us to take longer steps over the data whilst retaining model performance resulting in significantly lower training times, but also that this can result in models that achieve better performance over large step sizes than the original model over any step size, including updating the hidden state at every data point.
