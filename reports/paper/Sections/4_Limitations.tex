\section{Limitations}

\paragraph{Number of hyperparameters} Two new hyperparameters -- truncation depth and step size -- with substantial effects on training time and memory usage must now also be tuned.

\paragraph{Number of input channels} The log-ODE method is most feasible for low numbers of input channels, as the number of logsignature channels $\beta(v, N)$ grows near-exponentially in $v$.
